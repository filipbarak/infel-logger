# ISP Speed Logger

Everytime this node applet is run it will log an entry into a CSV file containing the ISP Name, download/upload speeds and a timestamp of when it was performed.

Useful combined with a cronjob to run it continuously to check if the speeds advertised by the ISP are actually real.

## To run

1. Clone this repo

2. Run `npm install`

3. Run `npm run start` inside the root of the app.


That's it!
